          The traditional exercise system as developed by Joseph Pilates is as much a workout for the mind as it is for
          the body. The Pilates Method is a focused journey through a complete system of mind-body exercises. The wellness
          journey inspires discipline &amp; insight as a valuable tool to overcome obstacles, cope with everyday problems,
          develop resilience to reduce inner conflict, become emotionally more balanced, and gain resourcefulness and
          increased vitality.</br>
          <br />
  
          Bay Pilates &amp; Wellness will assist you in reaching your goals by supporting your path to wellbeing in every
          area of your life. Using a truly holistic approach, Bay Pilates &amp; Wellness offers Pilates, massage,
          nutrition, reflexology &amp; life coaching. As a holistic principle to live from, we aspire to achieve
          <strong>real health</strong> through an integrated system of whole body wellness &amp; functional movement.

      <p>
          To achieve Real health, we believe in the underpinning principle as expressed by Joseph Pilates, in that your
          age lies not in years but in the degree of flexibility enjoyed by your spine. “If your spine is inflexible at
          30, you are old; if it is completely flexible at 60, you are young.”
