      The Pilates Method is a system of exercise that was designed by Joseph Pilates to be taught with one instructor
      to one client. During your private sessions, we will develop an individualized program to best suit your body's
      needs, working around any injuries, making you stronger and more flexible. More advanced clients benefit from
      private instruction to improve precision, add new exercises to their Pilates workout, work on a specific issue
      or on rehabilitation from injury.
